# Gnomes
You are a sharp-toothed, sharp-eyed, and sharp-minded little bastard aligned with the fey forces of chaos and change. You have a disdain for hierarchical society etched into your very bones, and the only thing you hate more than a petty tyrant is another gnome who disagrees with your definition of “hierarchical society.”
