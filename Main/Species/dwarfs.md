# Dwarfs
You are a stout, belligerent, luxuriously-bearded creature created from the stuff of deep earth in a bygone age. You’re literally as old as dirt, and with all likelihood each year only serves to make you more cantankerous.

***Special***\
Dwarfs are the oldest of the mortal races, and unique in that they do not eat, sleep, age, or tire. Multiply the Stamina you rolled during character creation by 3, but you may never heal.

## Miner
More grandiose Dwarfs would have others believe that a Miner is a second-rate sort of thing to be. You’ve always thought such Dwarfs to be fools. Without the Miner, there would be no mines, and without the mines leading far into the Yawning Deep, where would more grandiose Dwarfs get their materials? No, mining is not second-rate. Mining is the lifeblood of Dwarf culture.

## Shield-beard
Since no one’s ever figured out the trick Dögrun the World-Forger used to make them in the first place, the number of Dwarfs in the world lowers every year. It’s your job to help make that happen a little slower.
Shield-beards are known throughout the Realms as nigh-invulnerable warriors-for-hire, fond of battle, drink, and idle gossip.

## Artisan
What Dwarfs remain after all this time are, each and every one of them, obsessed with leaving a legacy. You leave your indelible mark on the Rambling Realms by creating works of masterful craftsdwarfship.\
Artisans are often considered hyper-focused weirdos by outsiders, but the results of the strange moods experienced by you and your peers are undeniable. From battlements and buttresses to swords and maces, from tiny toy horses to the venerable Dwarfen Safety Apparatus, the products of Dwarfen artifice are used by almost everyone. Indeed, the Artisan’s life is one of prestige, profit, and privilege. That you’re a little neurotic never set your career back any, even if it has lost you a few friends.
### Possessions
* Remote Mountain Workshop
* Underpaid Golem
* a Masterwork Weapon of your choice
* an IOU from a monarch who commissioned you some time ago
### Advanced Skills

* 3 Stubbornness
* 2 [Golemancy](../skills.md)
* 1 Tax Evasion

## Consul
It didn’t take long after their creation for Dwarfs to realize the value of teamwork. Teams of like-minded Dwarfs formed into Clans, and it was decided that once every quarter-century each Clan would send a Consul to the Great Dwarf Moot, to eke out Dwarf zoning laws, Dwarf taxation, and all manner of other Dwarfen politicking.\
You are one such Consul, and a damned good one if you do say so yourself. And you do. Say so yourself, that is.

* Collection of Treatises on Dwarfen Politics
* A Chateau in the Hills
* More Gold Bullion than is Technically Legal
### Advanced Skills

* 2 Stubbornness
* 1 Alcohol Tolerance

## Rune-beard
Once, many mortal lifetimes ago, High King Ingvald the Blue got it in his head that he would invade the Beard-peaks and tax the Dwarfs. In response, the Dwarfs decided to weaponize Runes for the first time.\
The Human kingdoms haven’t been unified since.
