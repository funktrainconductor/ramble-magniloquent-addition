# Elfs
You are a tall, slender, and graceful sort of flowering plant. People of other species often note that you and your kin have trouble staying in one place for too long, and that is an egregious understatement. You clearly remember an elder telling you that they’d rather be cut up, roasted in oil, consumed, and washed down with cheap wine than engage in what Humans call “homesteading.”

***Special***\
Elfs photosynthesize instead of eating. While you are properly hydrated and sunned, you gain 3 Spell – Treestride.

## Vagrant
In most Human minds (and all Dwarfen minds), “Vagrant” is an insult, but you’ve never found it to be any more objectionable than being called an Elf. It’s a verbal acknowledgment of observable fact, no more egregious than saying “Humans need to bathe more often” or “That Dwarf’s a stick-arsed little bastard.”

## Glade Guardian
Every ten years, the Elfs of the Rambling Realms travel to Askrgart, the Flowering Palace, to make merry, trade stories, and spread their pollen across the Seeded Grove, from which all Elfs sprout. Your job is to guard the secret of its location.\
Your assignment often takes you across the Rambling Realms, dispatching any and all existential threats to Elfkind.

## Grove-tender
Elf-Spells aren’t really Spells. They’re a bit more like prayers to the world itself, and specifically to the World Tree. Every Elf feels a connection to its branching roots, but your bond is particularly strong.

***Special***\
Animals flock to you, and plants thrive in your presence. You can spend 1-3 Stamina to cause a plant that you’re in direct contact with to double in size over the course of a minute. You can continue to do so for as long as you wish, spending another 1-3 Stamina for every additional minute that you do.

## Hiccup
Like all Elfs, you started life as a single flower in the sea of fresh blossoms that sprouts every ten years in the Seeded Grove. Unlike most Elfs, you bloomed into Strange Fruit, and grew up to be a whirlwind of pure magical chaos. You like to think of yourself as a bit of a hot mess, but most folk regard you as one would a natural disaster.

***Special***\
You are constantly enveloped by a whirlwind of magical energy. Whenever anyone attempts to cast a Spell or Elf-Spell within 20 meters of you, they roll 3d6 and only count the two highest dice. Additionally, whenever anyone within 20 meters of you rolls on the Oops! Table, they roll 3 times and you choose which one happens. You are also susceptible to these effects.
### Possessions
* Garish Clothes and/or Gaudy Jewelry and/or Loud Tattoos
* A Sizable Collection of Preserved Insects or Weird Marbles or Useless Currency
### Advanced Skills
