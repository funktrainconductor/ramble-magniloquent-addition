# Advanced Skill Descriptions
## Runecraft
Use this skill to carve runes into mundane objects without blowing yourself up, and to examine and reverse-engineer runes you find laying around. Decide when you carve a rune what the triggering conditions for the attached spell are. Examples include “when it shatters” or “when a hapless adventurer walks through the threshold it occupies” or even “when the smell of barrel-aged goat cheese permeates the air around it”. Have fun.\
Runes can only be triggered 1d3 days after they are carved, and when triggered, the corresponding Spell is cast with the rune as its origin. Carving a rune does not cost any Stamina. Instead, keep a tally of the total Stamina cost of spells you carve into runes. If you're a Dwarf, for every 10th point of Stamina tracked, take damage as Jolt. If by some miracle (or cruel twist of fate) you've gained this Skill and you're not a Dwarf, instead roll on the Oops! Table once for every ten points of Stamina tracked. 10 Stamina is one roll, 20 Stamina is two, and so on.
