# Items
## Dwarfen Safetey Apparatus
A specially-designed harness made for scaling up and down large underground caverns, chasms, and pits. It allows its wearer to climb without constant strain on their arms and legs, and grants them +2 Climb.
## Elfen Packpouch
An intricately crafted pack designed to be worn on the back. It’s technically not magical, but most folk swear they’re bigger on the inside. It grants the wearer +6 inventory slots, for a total of 18. Folk legends state that if an Elfen Packpouch is put inside another, it opens a portal to the Outside.
## Hand Cannon
An extraordinarily loud weapon that is held in two hands. It uses small lead balls etched with explosive runes called knotts as ammunition.
## Masterwork Weapon
An exquisitely-crafted piece, probably made by a Dwarf. Masterwork Weapons never corrode or age, and as such are immune to magical effects that corrode or age objects. Additionally, they are almost unbreakable – a Masterwork Weapon that experiences a spectacular clinch as the result of an exchange of Mighty Blows doesn’t break unless the other Weapon is also Masterwork.
## Vibrating Effigy
A small statue thrumming with divine power, carved in the likeness of a God. Grasp it tightly and say a silent prayer to regain a point of Luck. Vibrating Effigies can be used multiple times and each subsequent use gives an additional point of Luck, but for every use beyond the first, roll Prayer. If you roll double 6s, the Effigy breaks. Otherwise, roll on the Oops! Table. Breaking an Effigy won’t make its likeness happy.
## Vicious Weapon
A horrifying tool of painful death. Vicious Weapons deal three times their normal damage on a Mighty Blow, rather than merely double. Additionally, Vicious Weapons always ignore 1 point of Armor, even if they normally wouldn’t based on Weapon type.
