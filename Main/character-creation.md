# Character Creation
## Overview
Roll for Skill, Stamina, and Luck as in TROIKA, then mark down the possessions every character starts with: *traveler’s clothes, a backpack, a waterskin, 1d3 weeks’ provisions,* and *enough local currency to live comfortably for 1d3 weeks.*

Finally, pick your character’s Background and mark down any pertinent information on your character sheet.

The Backgrounds presented below are divided into two sections: the Backgrounds themselves, and Species that grant all Backgrounds associated with them additional special rules.

Optionally, with your GM’s permission, you may roll d66 for a Background instead of choosing. Do whichever is more fun for you and your table.
