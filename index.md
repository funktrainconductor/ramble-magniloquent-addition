# RAMBLE! Magniloquent Edition
## Introduction
You are reading a world-building exercise compatible with the mechanics laid out in TROIKA! Numinous Edition. RAMBLE! Magniloquent Edition is an independent production by myself, Jackalope Nesbitt, and is not affiliated with the Melsonian Arts Council.

More to the point, you’re reading a tabletop role-playing game. I can’t imagine too many situations where someone would read this document without knowing what that means, but if you stepped through an eldritch portal and a computer displaying this page was the first thing you saw, definitely use that computer to search for something like “What is a tabletop RPG” or “TROIKA! Numinous Edition” or “definition of Numinous.”

With that out of the way, this is as good a place as any to list the key hooks of RAMBLE. In no particular order, the world of RAMBLE is:

***A total conversion of the setting and flavor of TROIKA***\
RAMBLE isn’t TROIKA. While from a mechanical standpoint the backgrounds and other explicitly-described bits of flavor present in this document can (almost) all be plugged into a game of TROIKA and used alongside those described in that book, RAMBLE is designed to be a standalone experience. Treat everything present in a given chapter as a replacement for the options presented in TROIKA.

***Conventional fantasy with a strange aftertaste***\
RAMBLE is almost a normal fantasy setting. Its core assumptions are largely what you’d expect for a game in the grand tradition of fantasy settings inspired by the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, but my goal is to give fresh twists on some of the stereotypes present in more popular tabletop games. You know the one.

***Designed to cater to my tastes first and foremost***\
As well as the 1-to-1 conversions of tables present in TROIKA, RAMBLE also aims to include sets of optional rules for things that I find fun and/or interesting, including but not necessarily limited to trading material goods, brewing potions, compiling in-game encyclopedias, researching and developing custom spells, and building settlements, communities, hordes, bases of operations, and the like.

Taken together, these Optional Rules Modules likely represent the interests of a tiny fraction of whatever portion of the TROIKA community ends up taking the time to read this document. As with the rest of what is presented here, it’s all designed to be used at my table first and foremost. Your mileage may vary.
